# Assumptions and Simplifications

## Data Structure Assumptions
1. The input data is in a consistent JSON format with clear field names
2. All metric values are numeric and can be safely summed
3. Dimension values are strings or can be safely converted to strings for grouping
4. The data set is not extremely large (no pagination or virtualization needed)

## Functional Assumptions
1. Only SUM aggregation is supported for metrics
2. Only one metric can be displayed at a time
3. Row dimensions can be nested (hierarchical)
4. Column dimensions are flat (no nesting)
5. No need to handle missing or null values in the data
6. No need to support sorting of rows or columns
7. No need to support filtering of data

## UI/UX Assumptions
1. The pivot table will fit within a reasonable viewport size
2. Users can scroll horizontally and vertically to view all data
3. No need for responsive design beyond basic scrolling
4. No need for export functionality
5. No need for printing support

## Technical Assumptions
1. Modern browser support (no need for IE11 or older browser support)
2. TypeScript/ES6+ features are available
3. The data can be loaded via a simple API call
4. No need for real-time updates or data streaming
5. No need for offline support or data persistence

## Performance Assumptions
1. The data set can be processed in memory
2. No need for server-side aggregation
3. No need for caching of intermediate results
4. No need for optimization for very large data sets

## Security Assumptions
1. The data is not sensitive and can be loaded directly
2. No need for authentication or authorization
3. No need for data validation beyond basic type checking
